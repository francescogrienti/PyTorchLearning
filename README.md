# PyTorchLearning
Repository containing exercises with PyTorch. This should be a first approach to PyTorch tools in order to become skilled with them. It contains two exercises taken from the NumericalSimulationLaboratory repo 
which were developed using TensorFlow/Keras framework, but now the aim is to solve them using PyTorch.
